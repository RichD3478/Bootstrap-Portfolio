						<p class="paragraph-text">
							I am from Brooklyn, NY. Born and raised for most of my youth. Both of my parents are from Haiti and both gained
							U.S. Citizenship, so I am a proud Haitian-American. I moved around a lot in my mid to late twenties, between
							Citrus County, Florida to Cobb County, Georgia. All the while, my primary field of work revolved around customer
							service and HR services. I met my soon to be wife working as an HR Services Associate for Home Depot. Fast
							forward seven happily married years, two beautiful daughters and a move to Houston, TX... I was in search of a
							change of direction in my carrer path. So I decided to take a Full Stack Coding Boot Camp through the University
							of Texas for six months. My background from the user side of many different programs, in my opinion, gave me the
							perspective necessary for troubleshooting coding errors.</p>

						<p class="paragraph-text">
							I have transitioned to coding as I want to use the skillset I learn to become an entrepreneurial web developer
							for hire. My wife and I have already started our own business, Dorleans Company LLC, and plan on using it to
							branch into STEAM program teaching young children science, math, art, technology, engineering and incorporating
							coding into their curriculum.</p>

						<p class="paragraph-text">
							A few fun facts about myself: I love to play and watch basketball. I still take gigs as a party DJ from time to
							time. I love to have friends and family over for food and games. Spades anyone? To sum it up, I am a family man
							and am extremely close with my family.</p>
